Let’s face it, when we hear of a certain brand, their [logo](https://99designs.com/blog/trends/logo-design-trends/) immediately comes into our mind. The brightest brands out there have the most memorable logos engraved into our minds even if we don’t like it. We at Tribox Design, want to do just that! Not unlikable designs but rather memorable and impactful creations.

In light of another incredible year for the team, we are absolutely stoked to announce that The Manifest recently named Tribox Design as 2021’s most recommended and reviewed logo design company!

This is such an amazing recognition for the team. To honor this milestone, we’re going to take a quick trip down memory lane and look back at where it all began.

In 2017, Tribox Design was founded by Inusentes Catapusan and Regine Ylaya to deliver incredible solutions to brands in the country. Despite the daunting challenges and cutthroat industry we are in, our team remained unfazed. Our mission has always been simple — to empower and promote growth to local SMEs and brands.

We wanted to show that this Cebu-based team can offer world-class talents and creations. For us, our clients’ success means the world. That’s why when we found out that we’ve been recognized as one of the [top service providers](https://themanifest.com/logo-design/agencies#most-reviewed) thanks to their support, we were ecstatic.

To give context, The Manifest is an independent business blog platform designed to help connect corporate buyers with the right service providers. The site publishes different content about different B2B industries and locations globally.

It means a lot for us to be recognized as one of the best recommended service providers, not just here in the Philippines, but for the entire global logo design space. We hope to make Cebu proud!

“The Team Tribox Design would like to thank The Manifest team for the continued support not just for us but also to all creative agencies worldwide.” — Chief Executive Officer of Tribox Design
