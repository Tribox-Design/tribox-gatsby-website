  Izza Garlic is a Cebu-based fried garlic producer offering a variety of
  garlic-based condiments from fried bits to sweet chili oil.


  The company was brought to life in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic when, in addition to the virus itself, food became a primary source of concern. With dining out no longer being a practical option, many came to rely on home-cooked meals. However, home cooks faced new challenges, from running out of recipes and ideas to finding the task tedious and becoming a chore.


  To address these concerns, Izza Garlic came up with a way to spice up homemade meals and simplify home cooking and meal prepping for everyone in the city.
