  Izza Garlic is a Cebu-based fried garlic producer offering 
  a variety of garlic-based condiments from fried bits to sweet chilli oil.

  The company was brought to life in May 2020 during the
  COVID-19 pandemic when, in addition to the virus itself, food
  became a primary source of concern. With dining out no longer being a
  practical option, many came to rely on home-cooked meals.
  However, home cooks faced new challenges, from running out of
  recipes and ideas to finding the task tedious and becoming a chore.

  To address these concerns, Izza Garlic came up with a way to spice up
  homemade meals and simplify home cooking and meal prepping for everyone in the city.
