With over 10 years of operation in Baguio City, Philippines, Growfoods began as dealers of various processed meat products. Over the years, they have successfully expanded to produce their own line of meat products, including Filipino breakfast favorites such as tocino, ham, and longganisa. Freshly sliced meat is also available. Growfoods is committed to delivering high-quality meat products to every Filipino household.

Growfoods partnered with Tribox Design to refresh their decade-old brand positioning and identity. The goal was to give the company a fresh, modern face as they ventured into the digital world. The redesign process was a collaborative effort between Tribox Design, the founders, and stakeholders, ensuring the new brand direction aligned with the company’s core values and aspirations.

From discovery to application, the team successfully developed Growfoods' new mission, vision, goals, and value statement. The new brand tagline, “Right Choice. Right Taste,” symbolizes the company’s promise of delivering quality meat products to every Filipino household. The team also created a refreshed visual identity, which included a customized logo mark, modernized label color grading, and updated packaging that feels warm and contemporary while maintaining the essence of the original Growfoods brand.

"Tribox Design establishes a good relationship with their customers. This ensures that we are truly communicating who we are as a company."\
— Owner, Growfoods Meat Products

Upon completing the brand identity and strategy, Tribox Design developed a comprehensive brand manual outlining the do’s and don’ts of using the logo mark, layout guidelines, color palette, and graphic elements across various consumer touchpoints.

Overall, the collaboration between the founders of Growfoods and the Tribox Design team successfully addressed the company’s challenges and goals. Today, Growfoods competes with confidence and provides an elevated customer experience to its loyal customers and clients.
